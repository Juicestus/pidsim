# PIDSim
A simulator for various control systems that utilize PID.

## Simulations
### SwerveWheel
A simulator for the swerve wheel's turning functionality. It implements a wrap-around algorithm to minimize distance changed.

## Run
Use ```java Main.java```. PID filenames line up to the simulation (such as `swervewheel.txt` for SwerveWheel's simulator).
